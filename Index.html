            <h1> Loss of Mangrove Forest</h1> 
            <p>Mangrove forests are halophytic evergreen ecosystems, thriving in intertidal zones of sheltered shores, estuaries, tidal creeks, and mudflats within tropical and subtropical latitudes. The interconnectivity of these ecosystems makes them vital contributors to the health of both terrestrial and marine environment as well as play a crucial role in the ecological balance of coastal regions. </p>

            <p>These unique ecosystems can be found in 123 countries and territories globally, covering an estimated 15.2 million hectares of land. In the context of Malaysia, mangrove forests are concentrated along the west coast of the Peninsular, the estuaries of Sarawak, and the east coast of Sabah.
                Despite their significance, mangrove forests occupy less than 2% of the total land area in Malaysia, with a specific coverage of 641,886 hectares. Of this, 69% is gazetted as forest reserves, amounting to 441,092 hectares. The commitment to preservation is evident in the existence of 112 mangrove forest reserves, integrated into the Permanent Forest Reserve (PFE) system.</p>

            <p>However, the global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) report indicates a disturbing trend of substantial mangrove loss. Between 1990 and 2020, the world witnessed the disappearance of 1.04 million hectares of mangrove forest. In the context of Malaysia, there has been a concerning decrease from 467,760 hectares to 409,290 hectares over the past 30 years, as reported by the Forestry Peninsular Malaysia (policy & planning) to FRA. </p>
